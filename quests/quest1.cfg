Script = "1529 A.D.\nSomewhere southwest of La Flordia\n'Welcome ashore conquistadors!'\nA fat Spaniard approaches\n'Is this all of you? How many of you were aboard the [insert ship name]?', he begins to yell across the wind swept beach\n'No matter.'\n'I am your commander, Cabo Balboa'\nCloser now, he starts to spit orders, with a couple other frail men in tow\n'You are to do as I saw for the duration of your time on this beach. Any man devating with be punished. I'll see to it all the men on this beach are productive and in line.'\nHe begans to pace back and forth in front of you and your platoon\n'Well now, myself and these men arrived on the beach just about an hour before you. We've started scouting the beach and making note of things north and south along the shore. So far a barren land, BUT we have yet to scower the jungle. That'll be your job.'\n'If we are to explore this land, we'll first need an outpost.'\nTwo of the men behind Balboa begin handing axes to the men in your platoon.\n'Take these axes and fetch us some wood. Bring it here when you are complete and I'll have the men build us a shelter.'"
