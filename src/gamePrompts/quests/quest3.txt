Finally. The Coba pyramid. It's absolutely massive.
nearly as tall as the Cathedral of Barcelona. Maybe taller!
but where would the Amulet be?
The stairs, perhaps there is something at the top.

You climb the stairs, well over one hundred in number...

Incredible. Higher than any point in the forest. The jungle stretches on in every direction.
There is a door!
You push but it does not budge.
there are slots in the door, and engravings above each slot.
An engraving of a bird.
An engraving of a lizard.
And an engraving of a cat.

There must be objects that fit these slots. Maybe once they're placed, the door will open.
