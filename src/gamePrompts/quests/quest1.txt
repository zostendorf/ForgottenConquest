1519 A.D. 
 
The journey to the new world has been long... 
...but we are finally here! 
 
You and the other men unload from the ship onto a raft 
The Spaniard who paddled out to your ship is now bringing you and the others ashore 
 
You are at the Beach. The arrival point. 
"These are the men I was promised?" 
A short, fat man approaches... 
 
"You'll do I suppose" 
"I am your commander, Captain Bota 
 
Two other Spaniards fall in behind Captain Bota 
"You answer to me and no one else." 
 
"Well...." 
"If we are to stake this land for Spain, we'll need an outpost" 
"Go into the jungle west of here and collect some wood and other materials, then you men can get to building" 
 
Head into the jungle and collect wood, vine for rope, and palm leaves for roofing. Return to the beach once you've collected everything"
