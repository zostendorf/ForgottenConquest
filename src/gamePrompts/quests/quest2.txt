You are back at the beach, the arrival point. 
Savages line the beach. Captain Bota rests on his knees, bloodied 
 
A man emerges from behind the line of savages, but he does not look like the rest of them 
He looks like you, a man from the east 
The man pulls Captain Bota's head back by his hair. His eyes meet yours 
 
"You see what happens to unchecked ambition?", the man says, seemingly to you 
With his other hand, the man draws a dagger across Bota's throat 
Bota's body falls into the sand 
"Your captain would not cooperate. I'm hoping you will not make the same mistake" 
"I think it's time you understand why you are really here 
 
"You believe you were sent here to tame this land and stake it for Spain, Aye? "
"I assure you, the men you call leaders in Spain are drunk with power, but they are not fools" 
"Do you really think you came all this way for some sand and trees?" 
"No" 
"You are here for the same reason I am... " 
 
The man comes closer. Grining, as he takes a cloth from his pocket and wipes his blade of Bota's blood 
"We'll make good use of you Spaniard" 
 
"This jungle holds many secrets, but we are here for only one... and you are going to find it for me" 
 
"Deep in this jungle is a sacred place. A palace that rises above the trees. There, you will find my Amulet of Quetzal" 
"You bring it here, back to me, and I'll see to it can return to Spain"
"Until then, I'll wait here and continue to feast all this fine Spanish wine your Captain Bota left me. How I've missed the taste so much" 
"Well now, run along Spaniard. I'll be seeing you soon" 
 
Head into the jungle and retreive the Amulet
